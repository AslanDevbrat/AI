This means 1) there is just less input information, and if we look at some of the Cifar images I'm sure you'll agree that some are quite difficult to identify, even for us humans and 2) the kernals that extracted useful information from larger images might not apply as well to smaller ones. \n",

    "Additionally, different hyperparameters can dramatically impact the effectiveness of transfer learning. Some combinations will be very effective, others will lead to overfitting, others won't learn anything at all. With transfer learning it is important to consider the similarity of the task being trained, as well as the amount of data available. \n",

    "Slow and steady wins the race this time around. Based on the curve, and lack of overfitting we could probably continue to train this final model for several more epochs and continue to see improvements. I'll leave that as an exercise for your GPU.\n",

    "Taken together, the above experiments suggest fine tuning isn't working out for these two data sets and MobileNetV2. We got the best results from freezing the whole thing, or retraining the whole thing (but only when we train slowly!!). With fine tuning and a totally frozen pretrained network we ended up overfitting by a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could also be a good time to apply data augmentation to synthetically increase our dataset and make the task harder for the network to memorize. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, this is about what we expected. CIFAR and ImageNet really are not that similar, and with CIFAR we do have enough data to justify training the whole network. Starting with pretrained weights has been showen to generally improve the speed of reaching high performance, and this is something else you could easily test in this case with slight modifications to the above code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We need to experiment with fine tuning at a much lower learning rate with plain SGD to fully validate our hypothesis.** A slow rate worked very will with the full network unfrozen, but it might also work well with fine tuning. On the other hand, the more agressive `adam` performed horribly in both fine tuning and training the whole network.\n",
